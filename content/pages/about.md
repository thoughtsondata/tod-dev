'Thoughts on Data' is a project by data scientist and essayist Ivey. As an individual piece, this blog serves as a proxy for exploration of various topics in the mathematical and technological sphere. Though most posts are oriented to these two broad topics, others have a primary focus towards supplemental topics like neuroscience and technical writing. Despite varying subjects, the theme of expanding technical knowledge and optimizing retention of it remains all the same. 

Thereâ€™s a measurable amount of secrecy in the form of over complexity within the basics of data science, mathematics, and surrounding topics. This makes topics of nominal difficulty to be perceived as complex, biasing the interest in them towards those who quickly grasp whatever is being presented.

Thoughts on Data is an initiative to bring data scientists - aspiring and professional alike - to share knowledge, form teams, and present knowledge in a digestible form.
