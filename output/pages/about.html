    <blockquote>
<p>"What any person in the world can learn, almost all persons can learn if provided with appropriate prior and current conditions of learning." - Benjamin Bloom</p>
</blockquote>
<p>'Thoughts on Data' is a project by data scientist and essayist Malachi Ivey. As an individual piece, this blog serves as a proxy for exploration of various topics in the mathematical and technological sphere. Though most posts are oriented to these two broad topics, others have a primary focus towards supplemental topics like neuroscience and technical writing. Though subjects may vary, the theme of expanding technical knowledge and optimizing retention of it remains all the same. </p>
<p>In the first essay, 'Knowledge Representation', a concern is raised that Thoughts on Data has a primary aim of alleviating. Thereâ€™s a measurable amount of secrecy in the form of over complexity within the basics, making topics of nominal difficulty to be perceived as complex, biasing the interest in them towards those who quickly grasp whatever is being presented</p>
